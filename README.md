Potential Recession: 2019, 2020
===============================
Trade wars, end of Globalism and resurgence of mercantilism. Trump. Brexit. Eurozone banks (e.g. Deutsche Bank).

Interest Rates
--------------
Since 2009, the developed world has experienced a [low interest rate environment][9]. This has been driven by central banks in an effort to stimulate economic growth.  

In a low interest rate environment, the cost of borrowing becomes cheaper.

In August 2019, the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points - the first rate cut since December 2008.

Quantitative Easing
-------------------
Quantitative easing, along with low interest rates has lead to a Cantillon Effect whereby those closest to the money supply (e.g. those with access to cheap credit, or those who receive newly created money) are [enriched at the expense of wider society][12]. First-receivers get to use the money before it has a devaluing effect in the wider economy.

[Negative interest rates][7] are a relatively new monetary policy tool designed (not surprisingly) to discourage saving and encourage people to spend. If you don't spend now, you are charged for leaving money in the bank. This kind of policy is anathema to the Austrian school of Economics ([representative article][8]). It is also arguably 

International Trade
-------------------
China: [devaluation of the Yuan][3] - response to downshifting growth, Trump's trade war?

CEO of Circle, Jeremy Allaire believes recent Bitcoin movements are [linked to devaluation of the Yuan][5]. CNBC interview, YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf5dmNgIAgE][6].

Stock Market Valuation
----------------------
Are valuations inflated?

It is clear that share buybacks have had a significant effect on stock prices since the financial crisis. Low interest rates incentivize companies to purchase their own stock with money borrowed at cheap rates.

This has the effect of enriching top executives and making company performance look better.

Financial Markets
-----------------
Raoul Pal: former head of equities & equities derivatives, Goldman Sachs UK, founder of [Real Vision][3] financial news service. [Suggests that data is pointing to a big currency crisis][1] (biggest in his 30 year career).

Social Unrest
-------------
Widening inequality (as outlined above, in particular due to the [Cantillon Effect][13] has arguably influenced the rise of populism (Trump, Brexit, Gilet Jaunes etc.). 

Likelihood of Recession
-----------------------
What are the chances of a recession in the short-term (coming months)?

What are the likely timelines?

What are good positions to capitalise on the situation or weather the storm?

### Indicators
Falling Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) correlated with:

* Cass Freight Index Shipments - freight shipments have fallen
* Car loadings - collapsing
* Capital goods new orders, non-defence excluding aircraft - big ticket items requiring finance

Suggest capital goods are trending downward.

#### US Data:

Indicators that households are struggling:

* Car sales falling
* Clothing sales have collapsed in recent months
* US restaurant sales weak

Global semi-conductor sales are also in a downward trend.

US housing market - Case Shiller Index starting to weaken. Weakness in house prices, US new housing starts.

Shipping & goods transportation is weak, weakness in business expenditure and indications that consumer spending is also weak.

Unemployment in US is still low, but this is a lagging indicator.

See [Recession Crisis Indicators Explored][16], 0 - 5 min.

### Extent of Recession?
Is a mild slowdown coming or a major recession?

Demographics and debt profile suggest the latter. Downturn appears to be evident on a global scale - not in any single country.

### Potential Chain of Events
Raoul Pal, Real Vision:

#### Phase 1: Alarm Bells

* Business cycle weakens
* Credit spreads widen
* Corporate cash flow worsens
* Equities(shares) fall 
* Volatility increases

In progress - started October 2018

#### Phase 2: Strap In

* Business cycle weakens further
* Credit spreads widen further
* Corporate cash flow & profits decline
* Tax receipts fall
* Pensions stop buying debt
* BBB rated stocks fall, bonds fall
* Equities fall hard.

Next phase, Autumn 2019. If phase 2 plays out, the situation becomes more clear.

#### Phase 3: Ugliness Ensues

* Baby Boomers Sell Stocks - panic, get out of equities (permanently?)
* BBB debt downgraded to junk
* ECB/Euro governments bailout Euro banks
* Spreads explode, credit seizes up - pension funds forced to sell on downgrades
* Equities collapse - no natural buyers
* Pension funds default on obligations - big companies forced to bankruptcy

Opinion: Lakshman Achuthan (co-founder of ECRI)
-----------------------------------------------
"Slow walking towards a cyclical window of vulnerability."

Recession due to a negative shock? No - based on an endogenous cycle. Leading indicators suggest that we're in a downturn.

If leading indicators begin to fall further, virtually any negative shock can become a "recessionary shock".

See: [Recession Crisis Indicators Explored][18], 6min29. 

Opinion: Teddy Vallee (CIO Pervalle Global)
-------------------------------------------
Is the US entering recession?

__If__ it happens, it will happen between now and June 2020.

Never been a higher probability for US recession.

Opinion: Christophe Ollari (Founder, Ollari consulting)
-------------------------------------------------------
Central banks struggling/working to prevent downturn? Low interest rates, 14T on balance sheets.

Central Banks won't be able to do what they did in 2008, but will work hard to do what they can. This may prevent a recession in the short term.

Bullish on gold. Real yields will go lower, risk of debasement of the fiat currencies.
