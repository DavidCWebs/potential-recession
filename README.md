Potential Recession: 2019, 2020
===============================
Trade wars, end of Globalism and resurgence of mercantilism. Trump. Brexit. Eurozone banks (e.g. Deutsche Bank).

Interest Rates
--------------
Since 2009, the developed world has experienced a [low interest rate environment][9]. This has been driven by central banks in an effort to stimulate economic growth.  

In a low interest rate environment, the cost of borrowing becomes cheaper.

In August 2019, the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points - the first rate cut since December 2008.

Quantitative Easing
-------------------
Quantitative easing, along with low interest rates has lead to a Cantillon Effect whereby those closest to the money supply (e.g. those with access to cheap credit, or those who receive newly created money) are [enriched at the expense of wider society][12]. First-receivers get to use the money before it has a devaluing effect.

[Negative interest rates][7] are a relatively new monetary policy tool designed (not surprisingly) to discourage saving and encourage people to spend. If you don't spend now, you are charged for leaving money in the bank. This kind of policy is anathema to the Austrian school of Economics ([representative article][8]). It is also arguably 

International Trade
-------------------
China: [devaluation of the Yuan][3] - response to downshifting growth, Trump's trade war?

CEO of Circle, Jeremy Allaire believes recent Bitcoin movements are [linked to devaluation of the Yuan][5]. CNBC interview, YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf5dmNgIAgE][6].

Stock Market Valuation
----------------------
Are valuations inflated?

It is clear that share buybacks have had a significant effect on stock prices since the financial crisis. Low interest rates incentivize companies to purchase their own stock with money borrowed at cheap rates.

This has the effect of enriching top executives and making company performance look better.

Financial Markets
-----------------
Raoul Pal: former head of equities & equities derivatives, Goldman Sachs UK, founder of [Real Vision][3] financial news service. [Suggests that data is pointing to a big currency crisis][1] (biggest in his 30 year career).

Social Unrest
-------------
Widening inequality (as outlined above, in particular due to the [Cantillon Effect][13] has arguably influenced the rise of populism (Trump, Brexit, Gilet Jaunes etc.).
